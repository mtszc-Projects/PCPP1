3.2.1.1 LAB: CSV â€“ Lab 1
https://edube.org/learn/pcpp1-5/lab-csv-lab-1
When we buy a new phone, it's necessary to import old contacts. Why not import them from a CSV file? Look again at the
familiar contacts.csv file, and then design your new phone as follows:
create a class called PhoneContact representing a single contact. The PhoneContact class should contain the name and
phone properties;
create a class called Phone that will store your contacts. First, implement the method called load_contacts_from_csv,
responsible for reading data from the CSV file into the class property called contacts. The contacts property should
contain a list of PhoneContact objects;
add to the Phone class a method called search_contacts, which accepts any phrase entered by the user from the keyboard,
and then based on it perform a search for all matching contacts (case insensitive). If there are no results, print the
message: "No contacts found".
Example input:
Search contacts: mother
Example output:
mother (222-555-101)
mother-in-law (222-555-104)
Example input:
Search contacts: 103
Example output:
wife (222-555-103)
